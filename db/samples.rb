Whereas most grading systems start you off with 100% and then chips away at that “perfect grade” by averaging in each successive assignment, the grading system in this course starts everyone off at zero, and then gives you multiple ways to progress towards your goals. Different types of assignments are worth differing amounts of points. Some assignments are required of everyone, others are optional. Some assignments can only be done once, others can be repeated for more points. In most cases, the points you earn for an assignment are based on the quality of your work on that assignment. Do poor work, earn fewer points. Do high-quality work, earn more points. You decide what you want your grade to be. Learning in this class should be an active and engaged endeavor."

I encourage you to blog these thoughts on Piazza (we will pretend that Piazza is a blogging site for the purposes of this course). These may be analyses, critiques, or reviews of ideas both from and related to the course. Use the blog as a way to expand the range of technology we might consider. Use the blog to challenge ideas. Use the blog to communicate about things you come across in your travels that you think are relevant to the area of teaching and learning with technology.

Note that blog posts must be substantial to earn points. What “substantial” means is at the discretion of the professor (he knows it when he sees it). “Hello World” posts or posts that are simply duplications from other sites are not going to earn you any points. Also, see this insightful resource for information about plagiarism and blogging:
http://www.katehart.net/2012/06/citing-sources-quick-and-graphic-guide.html

In this course, I am requiring that you devote 20% of your time to pursuing a project of interest to you, that benefits you, and that will help you maximize the value of this course for you. You will determine the scope of the project, the requirements of the project, and the final grade for the project. You may work alone or with others. Whether or not there is a “product” is up to you, as is the form of that product. There is only one requirement for this project: You must share or present the project (in some way of your choosing) with your classmates and with me at the final class meeting.

We will make time during class for sharing, design jams, help sessions, etc. as we go along. The point of these sessions will be to inspire each other and yourself by seeing what others are up to. My office hours are also available to you for as much advice and guidance as you want to seek to support your work (sign up at http://bit.ly/16Ws5fm).

At the end of the term, you will tell me how many points out of the 20,000 you have earned.

I look forward to being surprised, elated, and informed by your interests and self-expression."
